Albert Einstein (/ثˆaةھnstaةھn/ EYEN-styne;[6] German: [ثˆalbة›تپt ثˆت”aةھnتƒtaةھn] (listen); 14 March 1879آ â€“ 18 April 1955) German-born theoretical physicist,[7] widely acknowledged greatest influential physicists time. Einstein best known developing theory relativity, important contributions development theory quantum mechanics. Relativity quantum mechanics pillars modern physics.[3][8] His massâ€“energy equivalence formula E = mc2, arises relativity theory, dubbed "the world's famous equation".[9] His work known influence philosophy science.[10][11] He received 1921 Nobel Prize Physics "for services theoretical physics, especially discovery law photoelectric effect",[12] pivotal step development quantum theory. His intellectual achievements originality resulted "Einstein" synonymous "genius".[13] Einsteinium, synthetic elements periodic table, named honor.[14]In 1905, year described annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published groundbreaking papers.[15] These outlined theory photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought laws classical mechanics longer reconciled electromagnetic field, led develop special theory relativity. He extended theory gravitational fields; published paper general relativity 1916, introducing theory gravitation. In 1917, applied general theory relativity model structure universe.[16][17] He continued deal problems statistical mechanics quantum theory, led explanations particle theory motion molecules. He investigated thermal properties light quantum theory radiation, laid foundation photon theory light.
